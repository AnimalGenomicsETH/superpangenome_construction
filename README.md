# Compare pangenome graph construction 

This project attempts to compare multiple pangenome graph construction.     

Consists of two experiment (in the respective folder):

- Simulated     
Assessing the pangenome graph performance from ground-truth simulated structural variations. 

- Real      
Assessing the graph performance from real data from graph statistics and (long and short-reads) mapping performance.
