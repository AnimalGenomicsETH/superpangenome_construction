# Graph construction method impacts variation representation and analyses in a bovine super-pangenome

This work focuses on comparing pangenome constructions methods for the downstream implications of how well (and truthfully) variation is converted into currently-useful formats like VCF.

This reposistory is currently a work-in-progress as code is centralised and cleaned up.

### Components

This project attempts to compare multiple pangenome graph construction.     

Consists of two experiment (in the respective folder):

- Simulated     
Assessing the pangenome graph performance from ground-truth simulated structural variations. 

- Real      
Assessing the graph performance from real data from graph statistics and (long and short-reads) mapping performance.
